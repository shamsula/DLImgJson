# DLImgJson

## Description
Simple script written in python to download image files (.jpg and .png) from urls nested in json-like files. 


## Instructions
Create a folder "res" at the root. Place the json-like file in the "res" folder. 
Rename the json-like file to data.json. Run main.py and hopefully you get some results (fingers-crossed)
